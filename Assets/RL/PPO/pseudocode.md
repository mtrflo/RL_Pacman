Yes, it is possible to implement the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm without batch learning, and instead use the samples collected at each time step directly to update the policy and value function.

The main difference between batch learning and online learning in PPO is the way samples are collected and processed. In batch learning, the agent collects a batch of experiences from the environment and then performs several updates using this batch. In contrast, in online learning, the agent collects a single experience at each time step and performs an update immediately after.

Here is an example pseudocode for how you could implement PPO without batch learning:

```
Initialize policy π with random weights θ
Initialize value function V with random weights φ

while not done do
    Get the current state s_t from the environment

    Take an action a_t using the current policy π(a_t | s_t; θ)

    Get the reward r_t and the next state s_{t+1} from the environment

    Compute the advantage A_t using a value function estimator:
        A_t = r_t + γ * V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)

    Compute the ratio between the new and old policy probabilities:
        r_t = π(a_t | s_t; θ) / π_old(a_t | s_t; θ_old)

    Compute the clipped surrogate objective:
        L_clip(θ) = min( r_t * A_t, clip(r_t, 1-ε, 1+ε) * A_t )

    Update the policy and value function parameters by maximizing the clipped surrogate objective and minimizing the mean squared error, respectively:
        θ, φ ← argmax( L_clip(θ) ) , argmin( E[ ( V(s_t; φ) - (r_t + γ * V(s_{t+1}; φ)) )^2 ] )

    Update the old policy parameters:
        θ_old ← θ

end while
```

In this pseudocode, the policy and value function parameters are updated after each time step, and the old policy parameters are updated accordingly. The clipped surrogate objective is computed using a ratio between the new and old policy probabilities, and the update rules for the policy and value function parameters are the same as in the batch learning case.

Note that in online learning, the updates are performed more frequently than in batch learning, which can lead to faster convergence and more adaptive behavior. However, online learning can also be more sensitive to noise and may require more careful tuning of the hyperparameters.

Overall, it is possible to implement PPO without batch learning, and the exact implementation may vary depending on the specifics of the environment and the reinforcement learning framework being used.
